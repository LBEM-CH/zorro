CHANGELOG
=======

ZORRO 0.7.2
======

* Initial implementation of testing module. These are in general slow tests, 
  as the majority problems in Zorro only manifest under load in my experience.
* Config file is now autosaved on exit if it was last loaded/saved from the 
  working directory.  Otherwise the assumption is it's a template loaded from 
  elsewhere and should not be modified.  
* Fixed a bug in reprocessing, where it deleted the log which is no longer a 
  necessary step.
* Changed default library for TIFF to Pillow as it has the fastest performance 
  for compressed TIFF.
* Improved outlier pixel handling when neighbouring pixels are outliers.
* Warning in zorro_util.rotmean regarding non-integer indexing has been dealt 
  with.  Same for zorro_util.img2polar
* File IO now requires the external package 'mrcz'.  Install it as 

   pip install mrcz
   
* Changed license for Zorro from MIT to BSD 2-clause.

ZORRO 0.7.1b1
=======

* Fixed a bug in Automator that flipped MRC/MRCZ names.
* Fixed a bug in IMS that was killing interactive Python scripts.
* Added tooltips in Automator.
* Fixed a bug in ioMRC that didn't cast double- to single-precision float
* Fix to skulkHost where a job could exit and not have its status updated.
* Added the ability to analyze the gain reference orientation under the menu
  "Analyze"
* Debugging output is now an option
* Fixed bug where Automator would lose the reference between its configuration
  dicts and its GUI elements.  
* Additional delay (5 s) was inserted in-between the end of file changes and 
  file syncing to facilitate slow MRC writing by SerialEM.
* Automator now only shows the base filename, but the ToolTip shows the state 
  and relative path.  Files that were previously synced are now lexicographically
  sorted.

ZORRO 0.7.1b0
=======

* Prototype MRCZ/MRCSZ format using multicore blosc compressor.  External utilities
  to convert back to MRC are on the TODO list.  Set compression options (code and 
  compression level) in the paths dialog.  It's not recommended for normal use yet.
* Removed unimplemented menubar items from Automator.
* Automator backend re-factored for unique ids for all items.  Remove and reprocess
  are much more stable now.  Projects can be stopped and restarted now at a later
  date without trouble.
* Fixed bug in hot pixel filter that could result in a crash if the image was 
  already histogram normalized.
* Status in the image display is now shown as a Tooltip.
* Fixed bugs with 4-bit MRC handling that was casting to float-64.
* Start of drift tracking in translations plot is indicated with a purple dot.
* Pop-ups now try to open with 2dx_viewer if it can be found in the system path.  
  If 2dx_viewer is not available, it uses zorro_plotting.ims instead.
* Fixed bug on Windows with relative pathing, for example if the cache was on C:\Temp
  and the current working directory on E:\Automator, the relative path could not be made.
* Errors raised in Zorro (i.e. trying to stack align a 2D image) should now propagate to 
  Automator and display as being in an error state.  They will no longer occupy 
  any queues or be further processed.
* Fixed GCTF calls not deleting all temporary files written by GCTF.
* IMS now has some additional features, "F" for FFT, "y" for polar transform, 
  'g' for Gaussian filter, for example.  See the help text under the help menu for 
  keyboard shortcuts.
* There is now an option to display debugging output under advanced options at 
  very bottom
* gctfHistogramFilter() in ReliablePy can be used to threshold results based on their GCTF 
  parameters.  Histograms for defocus, astigmatism, figure-of-merit, and fit resolution are generated.
  Also available as a script on SciCore: /scicore/projects/scicore-p-structsoft/scripts/gctfHisto.py
* Added some light low-passing of rendered large images (>3k) and FFTs to increase contrast.
* Fixed bug in Automator existing logs status disappearing after starting/stopping cycles.


ZORRO 0.7.0b0
=======

* Added support for 4-bit MRC images using the 101-type from SerialEM
* Added support for gain reference normalization.  The user is responsible for 
passing the Vertical, Horizontal, and Diagonal flips set in GMS at present.  The 
default is to rotate the gain reference by 180 degrees, which appears to be the norm
for Titan Krios equipped with a K2 on a GIF.
* Added stocastic hot pixel suppression.  It's highly advisable to use it with SerialEM acquired 
data, by adding 'hot' to the `filterMode`, e.g. `filterMode='hot,dose,background'`.
* Added support for CTFFIND4.1.  Because it is now very stable we recommend it, 
and it is the default for `CTFProg='ctffind'`.  CTFIND4.0 can be called as 
`CTFProg='ctffind4'`.  Default box shape for CTFFIND is now [1024,1024]
* Made some fixes to relative pathing.  On Windows machines if the temporary directory 
was on a different drive it generated an error.  Relative paths that span drives 
on Windows are still not available at present.
* A pixelsize of 1.0 in a DM4 will now not overwrite the Automator GUI value if it 
has no units.
* fouCrop = [0,0] will not apply any Fourier cropping (i.e. it will use all the 
information out to Nyquist)
* default saveMovie=True (was False). Will save the aligned MRCS movie files until Zorro
extraction is fully working.  This does waste a lot of hard drive space.
* Reported pixel errors are now the weighted error rather than unweighted. This should reduce
the influence of outliers on these metrics. This does not affect registration, just plotting.


ZORRO 0.6.2b0
=======

* Initial beta
